Experimental Symbian OS emulator, written in C++ 17. 

The emulator currently *emulates* Symbian OS's EKA1 and EKA2 behavior, and *reimplement* most of its critical app servers. It can already boot many EKA2's apps and games, with EKA1 being worked on at the moment. For more discussion and support, please visit our [**Discord server**](https://discord.gg/5Bm5SJ9).
