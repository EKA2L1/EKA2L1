     * Driver is a complete structure which takes and does request belongs to a specific
     * category. For example:
     * 
     * Graphic driver has the job of taking draw requests and render it to the screen.
     * Input driver has the job of tracking input from keyboard/pad and notify it to users.
     * 
     * The concept of driver here in the emulator are mostly the same as what you heard in mordern
     * computer, think of this as another nano-driver.
     * 
     * Driver in EKA2L1 hides the API difference between multiple API backends. For example, graphic driver
     * may use Vulkan API or OpenGL API, but here those API are hidden and wrapped, the client will not know
     * the implementation of the graphic driver, what API it use, but rather just send the requests, and the
     * driver will get it done.
